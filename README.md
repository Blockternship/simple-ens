# simple-ens

Mimo profiles with any ENS name (you won't need a mimoapp.eth subdomain!)

This is a vastly simpler Mimo contract, mainly because we don't need to setup our own registrar. These contracts are essentially a claims registry.

You can use any ENS name with this, such as wallet.eth or wallet.vitalik.eth, as long as you own the name of course.

I'll be rolling out this version of the contract if ever the ENS team plans on making the process for obtaining names simpler and faster. It currently takes 5 days to obtain an ENS names, this is simply unfeasible for a project trying to simplify identity across Dapps.
